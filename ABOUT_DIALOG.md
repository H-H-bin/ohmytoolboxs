## Implementation Details

### State Management
```rust
// Added to OhMyToolboxsApp struct
#[serde(skip)]
about_open: bool,
```

### Menu Integration
```rust
ui.menu_button("Help", |ui| {
    if ui.button("About").clicked() {
        self.about_open = true;
        ui.close_menu();
    }
});
```

### Dialog Rendering
```rust
// In update() method
if self.about_open {
    self.render_about_dialog(ctx);
}
```

### Build Information Integration
The dialog leverages build-time environment variables set by `build.rs`:
- `APP_VERSION` - From Cargo.toml
- `APP_DESCRIPTION` - From Cargo.toml
- `TARGET` - Build target platform
- `PROFILE` - Build profile (debug/release)
- `GIT_HASH` - Git commit hash
- `GIT_BRANCH` - Git branch name
- `BUILD_TIMESTAMP` - Build date and time

## User Experience

### Access Method
1. Open OhMyToolboxs application
2. Click **Help** menu in the top menu bar
3. Select **About** from the dropdown menu
4. About dialog opens with comprehensive information

### Closing the Dialog

- **Grouped Sections**: Information is organized in distinct groups with headers
- **Icons**: Each section has appropriate icons for visual clarity
- **Hyperlinks**: Technology links are clickable and open relevant websites
- **Grid Layout**: Version information uses a clean grid format
- **Consistent Spacing**: Proper spacing between sections for readability

### Color and Typography
- **Strong Headers**: Section titles use bold text styling
- **Italics for Subtitle**: Application tagline uses italic styling
- **Highlighted Version**: Version number is emphasized with strong styling
- **Professional Colors**: Uses application's theme colors

## Testing Status

### âœ… Completed Tests
- [x] Dialog opens correctly from Help menu
- [x] All build information displays properly
- [x] Hyperlinks work correctly
- [x] Close button functions properly
- [x] Dialog state management works correctly
- [x] Layout is responsive and professional
- [x] Integration with existing application theme

### Verified Information
- Version information from build system
- Git information (when available)
