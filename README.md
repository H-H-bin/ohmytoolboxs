## Building and Running

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (with Cargo)
- Git
- **Android Debug Bridge (ADB)** - Required for ADB Tools functionality
  - Install via Android SDK Platform Tools or standalone ADB
  - Ensure `adb` command is available in your system PATH
- **Android Fastboot** - Required for Fastboot Tools functionality
  - Usually included with Android SDK Platform Tools
  - Ensure `fastboot` command is available in your system PATH
  - **Important**: Fastboot requires devices to be in fastboot/bootloader mode
- **Qualcomm Tools** - Required for QDL and QRamdump Tools functionality
  - QDL (Qualcomm Download Tool) support for EDL/9008 mode operations
  - QRamdump tool support for memory dump collection and crash analysis
  - **Important**: These tools require Qualcomm devices in specific modes (EDL for QDL, crashed state for QRamdump)
