## Interface Customization

### Theme Selection

Toggle between dark and light themes:
1. Go to **View** menu
2. Click **Light Mode** or **Dark Mode** to switch
3. Theme preference is automatically saved

### Sidebar Management

- **Resize**: Drag the sidebar border to adjust width
- **Search**: Use the search box at the top of the sidebar to filter categories
- **Navigation**: Click on any visible category to access its tools

## Workflow Tips

### Minimal Interface Setup
For users who only need specific tools:
1. Open settings and deselect unused categories
2. Keep only the categories you frequently use
3. Enjoy a cleaner, more focused interface

### Developer Workflow
For software developers:
1. Keep Developer Tools and ADB Tools visible
2. Optionally hide Network Tools or File Tools if not needed
3. Use Text Tools for quick encoding/formatting tasks

### System Administrator Setup
For system administration tasks:
1. Keep System Tools and Network Tools visible
2. Show File Tools for file operations
3. Hide Developer Tools if not doing development work

## Troubleshooting

### Settings Not Saving
If your settings aren't persisting between sessions:
- Ensure the application has write permissions to its data directory
- Check that the application isn't running in a restricted environment

### Missing Categories
If some categories don't appear:
- Check the settings dialog to ensure they're enabled
- Use the "Select All" button to show all categories
- Clear the search box if you're filtering categories

### Performance Considerations
- Hiding unused categories can improve application startup time slightly
- The search function works on both category names and descriptions
- All settings are stored locally and don't require internet connectivity
